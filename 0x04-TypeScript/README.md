# frontend-javascript

Repository of frontend JavaScript / TypeScript exercises (ALX Pro Dev - Frontend).

This workspace contains a set of small exercises and examples focused on modern frontend tooling and TypeScript. The repository is organized into task folders. The example included here shows a TypeScript + Webpack setup with a small demo HTML page.

## Repository layout

- `0x04-TypeScript/`
	- `task_0/` — a TypeScript + Webpack example project
		- `package.json` — npm scripts and devDependencies (webpack, typescript, ts-loader, jest...)
		- `tsconfig.json` — TypeScript configuration
		- `webpack.config.js` — Webpack build/dev-server configuration
		- `js/main.ts` — example TypeScript entry file
		- `table-sample.html` — sample HTML used by the demo

## Quick start (Task 0)

These steps assume you have Node.js and npm installed.

1. Open a terminal and change into the task folder:

```bash
cd 0x04-TypeScript/task_0
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server (opens a browser):

```bash
npm run start-dev
```

This runs `webpack-dev-server` (configured in `package.json`) and will serve the demo. If you prefer to create a production build, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

The `build` script runs `webpack` and emits the compiled assets (by default to the configured `dist` directory).

4. Run tests (if you add tests):

```bash
npm test
```

## Notes

- The TypeScript setup uses `ts-loader` / `typescript` plus several dev tools (see `package.json` in `task_0`).
- `table-sample.html` is provided as a simple page to show the compiled bundle; the dev server will typically serve an HTML file generated by `html-webpack-plugin` or the configured static file.

## Editing and extending

- To add more tasks, follow the existing folder structure and include a small README inside each task describing the specific challenge.
- If you update dependencies, prefer to pin versions or update `package.json` via `npm install pkg@version --save-dev` as needed.
